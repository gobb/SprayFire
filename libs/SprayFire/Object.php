 * Primarily this interface is used to ensure that there is a way to
 *
 * - represent a class as a string, for debugging purposes if necessary or
 * for pure data objects and easy output
 * - compare 2 objects to see if they are equal to each other based on a means
 * that makes sense for the given object
 * - return a unique identifier for the given object
